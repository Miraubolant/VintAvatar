# 5 Essential Tips to Sell Faster on Vinted

Vinted has become THE essential platform for selling second-hand clothes. But with millions of users, how do you make your listings stand out? Here are our 5 tested and approved tips to boost your sales!

## 1. Photos That Make the Difference

**Secret #1: Quality of your photos**

Buyers on Vinted judge first with their eyes. A poor-quality photo can scare away a potential buyer, even if your item is great.

**Our advice:**
- Use natural light (near a window)
- Avoid blurry or too dark photos
- Show the item from multiple angles
- **Revolutionary solution:** Use our AI to create ultra-realistic worn photos in 30 seconds!

## 2. Catchy Title and Detailed Description

**The perfect title in 3 steps:**
1. Brand + Model (if known)
2. Clear size
3. Precise condition

**Example:** "ZARA Black Dress S - Excellent condition - Worn 2x"

**The winning description:**
- Complete measurements
- Materials and care
- Interesting story ("Bought for a wedding")
- Defects mentioned honestly

## 3. Competitive and Smart Pricing

**The golden rule:** Check similar items before pricing.

**Our technique:**
- Look at 5 similar sold items
- Position yourself 10-20% below the average
- Use psychological prices (€19 instead of €20)

## 4. Perfect Timing

**Best times to list:**
- **Sunday evening**: People browse for the week
- **Wednesday**: Mid-week activity peak
- **Avoid**: Friday evening and weekends

**The regularity trick:** List 2-3 items per week rather than 20 at once.

## 5. Optimize with AI

**The revolution is here!**

Traditional photos limit your sales potential. Our AI tool transforms your simple clothing photos into professional worn photos.

**Concrete benefits:**
- +300% more views on average

**How it works:**
1. Upload your clothing photo
2. Choose your virtual model
3. Our AI generates the perfect worn photo
4. Publish and sell!

## Bonus: Customer Service Excellence
