# AI Mannequin for Vinted: The Model Photo Revolution

Want to sell faster on Vinted but don't have anyone to model your clothes? The **AI mannequin for Vinted** is the solution you need. Discover how this revolutionary technology can transform your listings and boost your sales.

## What is an AI Mannequin for Vinted?

A **virtual AI mannequin** is technology that uses artificial intelligence to generate photos of clothes worn by a realistic model, without needing a real mannequin or person to pose.

**How it works:**
1. You upload your clothing photo (on hanger or flat lay)
2. The AI analyzes the garment (shape, color, texture)
3. A virtual mannequin is generated with your perfectly fitted clothing
4. You get a professional photo in seconds

## Why Do Model Photos Convert Better?

The statistics are clear: listings with **model photos** on Vinted get:

- **+300% more views** compared to flat lay photos
- **3 to 5 times faster sales**
- **More messages** from interested buyers
- **Fewer returns** because buyers better visualize the fit

Buyers want to see how the garment drapes, how it looks when worn. A hanger photo doesn't give them this crucial information.
