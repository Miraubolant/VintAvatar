# Artificial Intelligence in Service of Fashion: The VintedAvatar Revolution

The second-hand fashion industry is experiencing a silent revolution. Behind every perfect photo you see on Vinted, there's now a technology that's changing the game: Artificial Intelligence.

## The Genesis of Innovation

**The Problem:** How many times have you given up selling a garment because you didn't know how to photograph it? Or worse, how many items remained unsold due to unattractive photos?

**Our Solution:** A revolutionary AI that generates ultra-realistic worn photos of your clothes in less than 30 seconds.

## How Does It Work?

### 1. Upload & Analysis
Our AI analyzes your garment:
- Item type (dress, pants, t-shirt...)
- Colors and patterns
- Cut and style
- Material (visually deduced)

### 2. Model Generation
The AI automatically selects:
- The most suitable mannequin type
- The perfect pose to enhance the item
- Optimal lighting
- The background that will sublimate the ensemble

### 3. Final Rendering
In seconds, you get a professional worn photo, as if a professional photographer had worked with a top model!

## The Numbers That Speak

Since the launch of VintedAvatar:

**üìà +280% views on average**
Listings with AI photos generate 2.8x more views than traditional photos.

**‚ö° 30 seconds generation**
The average time to get a perfect photo.

**üí∞ +300% sales**
Some users have tripled their sales using our AI photos.

**üéØ 24,000+ conquered users**
And this is just the beginning!

## The Impact on Fashion E-Commerce
