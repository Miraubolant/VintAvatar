# 10 Mistakes Killing Your Vinted Sales (and How to Fix Them)

You're posting items but they're not selling? You're not alone. After analyzing thousands of Vinted profiles, here are the 10 fatal mistakes and how to fix them.

## Mistake #1: Poor Quality Photos

### The Problem
This is THE number one cause of failure on Vinted. A blurry, dark, or poorly framed photo = ignored item.

**Shocking stats:**
- 78% of buyers judge by the first photo
- Blurry photos: -85% clicks
- Poor lighting: -70% conversions

### The Solution
**The game-changer: our AI worn photos**
- Guaranteed professional quality
- Perfect studio lighting
- Garment showcased on a model

**Result:** +300% views on average!

## Mistake #2: Basic Hanger Photos

### The Problem
A garment on a hanger is... lifeless. The buyer can't imagine how it falls, how it would look on them.

**Comparison:**
- Hanger photo: 2% conversion rate
- Worn photo: 12% conversion rate

### The Solution
Use our AI to transform every hanger photo into a stunning worn photo. Buyers instantly visualize the garment on themselves.

## Mistake #3: Unrealistic Prices

### The Problem
**Too expensive:** Nobody buys, even with negotiation
**Too cheap:** Looks "suspicious" or "hidden defect"

### The Solution
**The 5-sold method:**
1. Search for 5 similar SOLD items (not for sale)
2. Calculate the average price
3. Position yourself within that range
4. Adjust based on condition and brand

**Psychological trick:** 19EUR converts better than 20EUR

## Mistake #4: Empty or Copied Descriptions

### The Problem
"Nice top, size M, good condition" = useless description

**What the buyer wants to know:**
- Real size and how it fits
- Material and feel
- Any defects
- Why you're selling it

### The Solution
**Complete description template:**
\`\`\`
[Type] [Brand] - [Main characteristic]

This [garment] is [emotional description].
[Reason for selling]

Details:
- Brand: [X]
- Size: [X] (fits [true to size/small/large])
- Material: [X]
- Condition: [X] out of 10
- Defects: [none / list honestly]

Measurements taken flat:
- Length: X cm
- Chest: X cm
- [other relevant ones]

Carefully shipped within 48h!
\`\`\`

## Mistake #5: Ignoring Messages

### The Problem
You respond 3 days later? The buyer has already bought elsewhere.

**Timing matters:**
- Response < 1h: 80% conversion
- Response 1-24h: 40% conversion
- Response > 24h: 10% conversion

### The Solution
- Enable Vinted notifications
- Respond even "Let me check and get back to you!"
- Prepare template responses for frequent questions

## Mistake #6: Single Photos

### The Problem
One photo only = insufficient information = no purchase

**Recommended minimum:** 4-5 photos

### The Solution
**The winning combo:**
1. **AI worn photo**: Attractive overview
2. **Detail photo**: Fabric, texture, quality
3. **Label photo**: Brand, size, composition
4. **Defects photo**: If applicable, transparency
5. **Extra photo**: Another angle or detail

## Mistake #7: Bad Publishing Timing

### The Problem
Publishing at 3am or during holidays = buried item

### The Solution
**Best times 2025:**
- **Sunday 6pm-10pm**: Preparing for the week
- **Tuesday/Wednesday 12pm-2pm**: Lunch break shopping
- **Thursday 8pm-10pm**: Weekend approaching

**Avoid:**
- Friday evening and Saturday (outings)
- School holidays
- Public holidays

## Mistake #8: Ignoring Vinted SEO

### The Problem
Title "Black top" = impossible to find in searches

### The Solution
**Optimize your title:**
\`\`\`
[Brand] [Type] [Characteristic] [Size] [Condition]
Example: ZARA Lace Top Black M New
\`\`\`

**Strategic keywords:**
- Include the full brand name
- Use synonyms (top, blouse, shirt)
- Add trends (cottagecore, Y2K, minimalist)

## Mistake #9: No Strategic Boosting

### The Problem
Your items are buried under thousands of others

### The Solution
**Smart boost strategy:**
- Boost your best pieces on Sunday evening
- Re-list items with no views after 2 weeks
- Use the free daily boosts

**Synergy with AI photos:**
Boost IN PRIORITY items with AI worn photos - best ROI!

## Mistake #10: Neglected Profile

### The Problem
Profile without photo, without description = zero trust

**Profile impact:**
- Complete profile: +90% buyer trust
- Visible reviews: +75% conversion
- Pro description: +50% followers

### The Solution
**Perfect profile checklist:**
- Clear and smiling profile photo
- 2-3 line description (style, specialty, commitment)
- Respond to received reviews
- Regular publications
