# Why Use Model Photos on Vinted

If you're a seller on Vinted, you know how crucial the presentation of your items is. High-quality model photos can make all the difference. They allow buyers to visualize the clothing in a real context, significantly increasing the chances of sale. In fact, a study showed that AI model photos can increase your listing views by 300% and reduce the selling time by three times.

## Why Choose VintDress for Your Model Photos?

### Professional Quality at Your Fingertips

VintDress offers you a premium service to create high-quality model photos. With our FLUX 2 Pro technology, you receive a realistic rendering that is indistinguishable from a real photo. In just 30 seconds, you can generate a high-definition image that showcases your clothing like never before.

### Complete Customization

With VintDress, you can fully customize your AI model: gender, body type, skin tone, pose, and backgrounds are all at your disposal. Whether you want a dynamic photo or a studio shot, our intuitive interface allows you to easily configure every detail.

#### Affordable Cost for High Return on Investment

You might think that creating model photos involves free tools, but think about it for a moment. Free services often mean poor quality. Here are some common issues you may encounter:
- **Blurry Quality**: Generated images often lack sharpness.
- **Visible Watermarks**: Free tools add logos, which detracts from the professional presentation of your items.
- **Endless Waits**: You might find yourself waiting 30 minutes to generate a single image.
- **Distorted Clothing**: Free tools can distort items, making the presentation misleading.

In addition to these drawbacks, the time you spend using these free tools translates into lost money. By investing from €0.40/photo with VintDress, you ensure high-quality images that attract buyers. Just one additional sale, often between €15 and €25, is enough to easily cover the cost of your photos.
