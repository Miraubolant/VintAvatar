# Vinted Algorithm: The Secrets to Being Visible in 2025

The **Vinted algorithm** determines which listings appear first in searches. Understanding how it works is the key to selling faster. Here's everything you need to know to maximize your visibility.

## How Does the Vinted Algorithm Work?

Vinted's algorithm analyzes several criteria to rank listings. Contrary to what many think, it's not just about price.

### Key Ranking Factors

**1. Photo Quality**
This is the #1 factor. The algorithm favors listings with:
- Sharp, well-lit photos
- Multiple angles of the garment
- High-resolution images
- Model photos (the most impactful criterion)

**2. Listing Engagement**
The more interactions your listing generates, the higher it ranks:
- Number of views
- Added to favorites
- Messages received
- Shares

**3. Listing Freshness**
New listings and recently updated ones are temporarily boosted.

**4. Seller Reputation**
- Number of positive reviews
- Message response rate
- Sales history
- Account age

**5. Keyword Relevance**
The title and description must match what buyers are searching for.

## Strategy 1: Optimize Your Photos for the Algorithm

Photos are the most powerful lever. The Vinted algorithm can detect:

### What the Algorithm Likes
- Model or mannequin photos
- Clean, neutral background
- Good lighting
- Multiple photos (4-5 minimum)
- High resolution

### What the Algorithm Penalizes
- Blurry or dark photos
- Single photo only
- Photos with watermarks or text
- Over-compressed images

### The Solution: AI Mannequins

**Model photos** are the strongest signal for the algorithm. Problem: not everyone has someone to pose.

That's where VintDress comes in. Our AI generates ultra-realistic mannequin photos that:
- Show the garment worn (strong algorithm signal)
- Are high resolution
- Feature professional poses
- Drastically increase engagement

## Strategy 2: Master Publication Timing

The algorithm boosts new listings for 24-48h. Take advantage!

### Best Times to Publish

**Optimal days:**
- Sunday: preparing for the week
- Wednesday: midweek, shopping mood
- Friday: weekend start

**Optimal hours:**
- 12pm-2pm: lunch break
- 6pm-9pm: after work
- 9pm-11pm: relaxed browsing

### The Bump Technique

Refresh your listings regularly:
- Slightly modify the price
- Add or change a photo
- Update the description

The algorithm treats this as a "new" listing.

## Strategy 3: Optimize Titles and Descriptions

### The Perfect Title Structure

\`\`\`
[BRAND] [Garment type] [Size] - [Condition] [Color]
\`\`\`

**Examples:**
- "ZARA Midi Dress M - New with tags Black"
- "NIKE Air Force 1 42 - Very good condition White"
- "H&M Oversized Sweater L - Like new Beige"

### Strategic Keywords

Include in your description:
- The brand (multiple times naturally)
- The exact garment type
- The season (summer, winter...)
- The occasion (evening, casual, office...)
- The materials (cotton, linen, wool...)

## Strategy 4: Boost Engagement

More engagement = better ranking.

### Techniques to Increase Engagement

**Respond quickly to messages:**
The algorithm measures your response time. Respond within the hour if possible.

**Offer bundles:**
Bundles generate more interactions and are featured.

**Interact with the community:**
Add favorites, comment, follow other sellers. Activity counts.

**Set negotiable prices:**
Prices that are too firm discourage initial interactions.

## Strategy 5: Build Your Reputation

The algorithm favors trusted sellers.

### How to Improve Your Score

- Ship quickly after sale
- Package items carefully
- Be honest in descriptions
- Stay courteous in exchanges
- Accumulate positive reviews

### The Snowball Effect

Good reputation → Better ranking → More sales → Even better reputation

## The Impact of AI Photos on the Algorithm

Our VintDress users see:

| Metric | Without VintDress | With VintDress |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Views per listing | 50-100 | 200-400 |
| Added to favorites | 2-5 | 10-20 |
| Time to sale | 2-4 weeks | 3-7 days |
| Average position | Page 2-3 | Page 1 |

**Why?** Because professional model photos:
- Attract more clicks (positive signal)
- Generate more favorites (positive signal)
- Trigger more messages (positive signal)

The algorithm interprets all these signals as "this listing interests buyers" and promotes it.

## Mistakes to Avoid with the Algorithm

### 1. Spamming Listings
Posting too many listings at once can be seen as spam.

### 2. Copy-Pasting Descriptions
Each listing must have a unique description.

### 3. Unrealistic Prices
Prices too low or too high are penalized.

### 4. Ignoring Messages
A low response rate impacts your ranking.

### 5. Poor Quality Photos
This is THE most negatively impactful factor.

## Immediate Action Plan

### This Week

1. **Audit your photos**: replace blurry or poorly lit photos
2. **Create model photos** with VintDress for your best items
3. **Optimize 5 titles** with brand + type + size + condition structure

### This Month

1. **Establish a publication schedule** (3-4 listings per week at optimal times)
2. **Respond to all messages** within the hour
3. **Update old listings** to "bump" them

## Conclusion

The Vinted algorithm isn't a mystery. It rewards:
- Quality photos (especially model shots)
- Generated engagement
- Listing freshness
- Seller reputation

By combining these strategies with **professional VintDress photos**, you maximize your chances of appearing at the top of searches and selling quickly.
