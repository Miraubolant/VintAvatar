# Success Story: How Marie Earns €800/Month on Vinted

Meet Marie, 22, a marketing student in Lyon who has transformed her passion for fashion into a thriving business on Vinted. In 12 months, she went from selling her old clothes to generating €800 monthly revenue. Here's her inspiring journey.

## Marie's Profile

### The Beginning

**Before Vinted:**
- Marketing student at EM Lyon
- Fashion enthusiast since age 16
- Limited budget for new clothes
- Overstuffed closet with unworn items

**The trigger:** "I had over 50 pieces I never wore. I needed money for my studies, so I decided to try Vinted."

### First Steps (Month 1-2)

**Beginner mistakes:**
- Photos taken with poor lighting
- No clear pricing strategy
- Basic descriptions
- Random posting schedule

**Results:** 3 sales in 2 months, €45 revenue

**Marie's realization:** "I understood that to succeed, I needed to be professional, even for secondhand sales."

## The Transformation (Month 3-6)

### Strategic Shift

**What changed:**

- Apply progressive reduction after 3 weeks
